# Semantic html

## Description

This repository is for submitting Module 1 Challenge. The activities done in this challenge are:

- Modified div tags to semantic tags
- added alt attributes to image elements to increase the accessibility
- modified heading elements so they are more logical: eg. h1 followed by h2
- change the title value in the head section to the name of the company

When first deployed, the index.html file was not in the root folder and therefore there was an issue deploying the page. Later it was fixed by moving index.html to the root folder. The links to images were also adjusted according to changed file location.
